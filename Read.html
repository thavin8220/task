	 in an engineering course, moreover, I really admire the fact that the college does give the student a better stage to showcase their talent.<br>Analysis of Determinate 
	 Structures and Basic Materials and Construction were some of my subjects I learned during the commencement of my program. The course was explained by professors. I can 
	 understand the concept easily.</b></i></p>
